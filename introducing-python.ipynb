    "\n",
    "All computer programs manipulate data, and thus every programming language provides a means for the programmer to represent data, as well as to reference data for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __value__ in a program is a syntax term which appears on the right-hand-side (RHS) of an assigment operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An __object__, in programming sense, is a type of in-memory data structure which contains not only the state or value of the entity the structure tries to represent (often referred to as \"fields\"), but also a set of actions the structure can perform (often referred to as \"methods\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these methods could change the state of the fields within the object, while some could output information about this object; some can do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in programs are supposed to mimick real-life objects, in the sense that real-life objects have both states and things they can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a real-life pen can have a length, and a colour, these are its state. Two pens can have different length or colour—thus different states. A pen can also write things on paper. And the write functionality also depends on the colour of the pen—a red pen would draw a red line for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a program, an in-memory object representing a pen would have the same states (or fields/attributes), length and colour, and it will also have a method write(), whose behaviour is dependent on colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects always have a type. There is a distinction between a particular red pen (an \"instance\"), and the type of pen. We can have multiple objects of the same type: we can have 2 red pens, 3 blue pens and so on, but a pen would always have a length, a colour, and the functionality of being able to write. On the other hand, a bicyle will have entirely different set of fields and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object data structure allows a programer to write programs by treating it as a machine with many components, with each component being an object. And just like in real-word, different \"machines\" can share same components. Writing programs therefore is about definging the different object types, and creating instances of those types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all values are objects — in other words, all values in python are stored in memory with both a set of states and a set of methods."
